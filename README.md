# Resume for software engineer using Markdown.
This repository discusses about how to make a resume for Software engineer using Markdown. There are many kinds of resume but I created a sample resume written by 'Markdown'. I think this sample will be useful for any positions within any company. A colorful and creative resume is also attractive. However resume(non-portfolio) need to be concise at times. Therefore I recommend this type of resume to software engineers.
